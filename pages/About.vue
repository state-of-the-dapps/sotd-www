        <p class="intro">State of the ÐApps is a not-for-profit curated directory of Decentralized Applications, also called ÐApps, which run on various several blockchains.
        State of the ÐApps was initially created to categorize and showcase developed projects built on the <a 
          href="https://ethereum.org/" 
          target="_blank" 
          rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> Blockchain, but more recently we have added support for 
          <a

            rel="noopener">EOS</a>,
          <a 
            href="https://poa.network/" 
            target="_blank" 
            rel="noopener">POA</a> and
          <a 
            href="https://steem.com/" 
            target="_blank" 
            rel="noopener">Steem</a> as well.</p>
        <p>The inspiration for State of the ÐApps came from FreshMeat now known as <a 
          href="http://freecode.com/" 
          target="_blank" 
          rel="noopener">FreeCode</a> which was a site reference for Linux users, which had a big inventory of the open source applications, games and all sources for Linux.</p>
        <p>In State of the ÐApps there are many projects covering different fields such as health, Ponzi schemes, games, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, education, registries, job markets, tinder for horses and many more. The directory has become one of the biggest reference for the Ethereum ecosystem, we are referred to in talks, workshops, meetups; <a

        <p>We already have a really wonderful team contributing to the growth of the project, and our goal is to connect ÐApp creators and users.</p>
        <p>State of the ÐApps is a privately funded and independent project. We are open to collaboration with others when it is a good match for both parties, but what makes us successful is our autonomy &amp; objectivity.</p>

        <p>And remember... smart contracts are neither smart, nor contracts!</p>
